## Bloons TD 6
- v1.0.2 - Current Version (18/12/25 23:11 UTC)
  - Fixed issue with maps lists that caused the implementation to throw out quite possibly the opposite issue.
  - Seriously the error message it gave me was that it lacked the argument self, but the actual issue was HAVING the argument self where it wasn't needed.
- v1.0.1 (09/12/25 23:56 UTC)
  - Added docstrings describing the implementation and game for use on the kmk codex.
- v1.0.0 - Inital Version (04/12/25 19:45 UTC)
  - Options to include or disclude the different map groups and difficulty modes.
  - Options to include boss bloon challenges.
  - Tasks are to clear maps on different modes, or to clear certain tiers of boss bloons on specific maps.
  - Optional restrictions are copied from the implementation in SerpantAI's archive:
    - Not using heroes
    - Not using tier 5 upgrades
    - Disabling all Monkey Knowledge
## Umamusume: Pretty Derby
- v2.0.3 - Current Version (09/12/25 23:51 UTC)
  - Added docstrings describing the implementation and game for use on the kmk codex.
- v2.0.2 (07/12/25 21:09 UTC)
  - My boyfriend pointed out a typo, so I have fixed it.
  - For those curious, I'd accidentally listed the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies race as Hansin instead.
- v2.0.1 (04/12/25 15:25 UTC)
  - Turns out I coded it wrong, so any objectives based on options weren't appearing at all.
  - I have fixed it.
- v2.0.0 (02/12/25 23:51 UTC)
  - Added the following umas that I was behind on to the default trainee list:
    - Agnes Digital
    - Hishi Akebono
    - Kawakami Princess
    - The Halloween Outfits for Rice Shower and Super Creek
  - Renamed option for including EX Races to change it to reflect that it's just an option for including URA Finale.
  - Split the main objectives so as to mark challenges with the URA Finale as difficult.
  - Added an option for including Unity Cup.
  - Added unique challenges more suited to how Unity Cup functions, to pair with the added option.
  - Added option to include trainee-specific challenges (which, to avoid issues, removes the specific trainee optional constraint when on).
  - Added a few changes to option descriptions.
- v1.1.7 (06/11/25 22:09 UTC)
  - Added new Matikanefukukitaru outfit to default trainee list.
  - Called it Full Armour because that's what gametora seems to be calling it. Not sure why it's called that.
- v1.1.6 (30/10/25 23:21 UTC)
  - Added Eishin Flash to default trainee list, due to her addition to Global.
- v1.1.5 (23/10/25 14:45 UTC)
  - Added Meisho Doto to default trainee list, due to her addition to Global a few days ago.
  - Removed the weird extra blank lines at the end that kept being added with each previous change - not sure why github's been doing that.
- v1.1.4 (21/10/25 16:13 UTC)
  - Fixed the typo of Nakayama Kimpai being spelt as "Nakayama Kimapi".
- v1.1.3 (14/10/25 22:20 UTC)

  - Tasks are to place certain placements or better in different races.
  - Optional Restrictions are to use a specific Uma (from your list), to only train a specific stat, or to clear a keep in as few career runs as possible.
