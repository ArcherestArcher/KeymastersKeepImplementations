Implementation Version Notes:
- Umamusume: Pretty Derby v1.0.0 (25/09/25)
  - Option to list all your owned Umas, defaults to all current Umas in Global.
  - Option to include or disclude different race grades, or ex races (for now just URA Finale variations).
  - Tasks are to place certain placements or better in different races.
  - Optional Restrictions are to use a specific Uma (from your list), to only train a specific stat, or to clear a keep in as few career runs as possible.
