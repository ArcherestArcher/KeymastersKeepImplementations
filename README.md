## Umamusume: Pretty Derby
- v2.0.0 - Current Version (02/12/25 23:51 UTC)
  - Added the following umas that I was behind on to the default trainee list:
    - Agnes Digital
    - Hishi Akebono
    - Kawakami Princess
    - The Halloween Outfits for Rice Shower and Super Creek
  - Renamed option for including EX Races to change it to reflect that it's just an option for including URA Finale.
  - Split the main objectives so as to mark challenges with the URA Finale as difficult.
  - Added an option for including Unity Cup.
  - Added unique challenges more suited to how Unity Cup functions, to pair with the added option.
  - Added option to include trainee-specific challenges (which, to avoid issues, removes the specific trainee optional constraint when on).
  - Added a few changes to option descriptions.
- v1.1.7 (06/11/25 22:09 UTC)
  - Added new Matikanefukukitaru outfit to default trainee list.

  - Added Eishin Flash to default trainee list, due to her addition to Global.
- v1.1.5 (23/10/25 14:45 UTC)
  - Added Meisho Doto to default trainee list, due to her addition to Global a few days ago.
  - Removed the weird extra blank lines at the end that kept being added with each previous change - not sure why github's been doing that.
